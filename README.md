# Toll Management System

A desktop-based Toll Management System designed to streamline toll booth operations, reduce manual workload, and improve transaction efficiency. This solution automates vehicle toll collection, employee management, customer registration, pricing configuration, reporting, and record handling using a traditional yet reliable VB.NET and SQL Server architecture.

## 🚦 Project Overview

The system digitizes toll gate workflows, replacing paper-based and error-prone processes with a structured and centralized application. It empowers toll operators to authenticate, record vehicle entries, calculate toll fees, and generate reports with minimal turnaround time.

This project aligns with legacy enterprise system practices while offering a foundation for modernization and scalability.
